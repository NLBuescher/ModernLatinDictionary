{"name":"Modern Latin Dictionary","tagline":"This is a Modern Latin dictionary project written using Mac OS X, Xcode 6, and the Dictionary Developer Tools from Apple.","body":"# About\r\n\r\nThis is a dictionary project written using Mac OS X, Xcode 6, and the Dictionary\r\nDeveloper Tools from Apple. Entries include both Latin-English and English-Latin\r\ndefinitions.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nNOTE: You must be running Mac OS X 10.7+ to build and run the project. It is\r\npossible to edit the XML file that contains all of the entries on any OS with\r\na text editor, and to commit changes to the project with Git, but building and\r\nusing the dictionary requires Mac OS X.\r\n\r\n#### Setting up the development environment\r\n\r\n##### 1. Install Xcode\r\n\r\nXcode is available gratis from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).\r\n\r\n![Xcode on the App Store](https://raw.github.com/NLBuescher/ModernLatinDictionary/gh-pages/images/xcode_app_store.png)\r\n\r\n##### 2. Download the \"Auxiliary Tools for Xcode\" from the Apple developer page\r\n\r\nFirst, navigate to the [Mac Dev Center Website](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action)\r\nand sign in. If you do not have an apple developer account, you can register \r\nyour apple ID as free developer account. (NOTE: This is not the same as the\r\nyearly subscription to the Mac Developer Program which costs $99/yr)\r\n\r\nOnce you've signed in, click on \"View all downloads\" under the section labeled\r\n\"Additional Downloads\". This will take you to the search dialog for all of the\r\ndeveloper resources for Mac development.\r\n\r\nHere you are looking for the \"Auxiliary Tools for Xcode\". Download the most recent\r\nversion and open the DMG file.\r\n\r\nFrom the DMG, copy the \"Dictionary Development Kit\" into \"/Applications/Utilities/\".\r\nThe Makefile for this project is preconfigured to use that directory.\r\n\r\n#### Editing the Code\r\n\r\nTo edit the code, simply clone the repository onto your own machine, and open the\r\nproject with Xcode. We recommend using the Github desktop app for ease of use.\r\n\r\n#### Building the Dictionary\r\n\r\nThe project is preconfigured to use the Makefile for building and automatically \r\nputs the resulting .dictionary file into the \"~/Library/Dictionaries\" directory.\r\n\r\n##### Style Guidelines\r\n\r\nIn general follow the standards set by the existing entries.\r\n\r\n1. Normal Latin text does not have macrons; Only the dictionary entries\r\n   themselves include macrons. All of the search terms and English-Latin\r\n   definitions have to have macrons, whereas all example sentences should not\r\n   have macrons\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
