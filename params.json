  "body": "# About\r\n\r\nThis is a dictionary project written using Mac OS X, Xcode 6, and the Dictionary\r\nDeveloper Tools from Apple. Entries include both Latin-English and English-Latin\r\ndefinitions.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nNOTE: You must be running Mac OS X 10.7+ to build and run the project. It is\r\npossible to edit the XML file that contains all of the entries on any OS with\r\na text editor, and to commit changes to the project with Git, but building and\r\nusing the dictionary requires Mac OS X.\r\n\r\n#### Setting up the development environment\r\n\r\n##### 1. Install Atom\r\n\r\nAtom is my personal preferred choice of text editor, so that's what I use and\r\nrecommend, but you can use any text editor of your choice. If you also want to\r\nuse Atom, you can find the download [here](https://atom.io).\r\n\r\n##### 2. Auxiliary Tools for Xcode\r\n\r\nAs of my switch to Atom I've included the Dictionary Development Kit from Apple\r\nin the project files (I couldn't find any document in it saying that I *couldn't*\r\ndo that), so you no longer need to download this separately.\r\n\r\n#### Editing the Code\r\n\r\nTo edit the code, simply clone the repository onto your own machine, and open the\r\n`ModernLatinDictionary.xhtml` file. Please see the section on [Style Guidelines](#style-guidelines)\r\nbefore making changes. I also recommend using the Github desktop app for ease of use.\r\n\r\n##### Style Guidelines\r\n\r\nIn general follow the standards set by the existing entries.\r\n\r\n1. Normal Latin text does not have macrons; Only the dictionary entry titles\r\n   themselves include macrons. All of the search terms and English-Latin\r\n   definitions have to have macrons, whereas all example sentences, etc. should\r\n   NOT\r\n   have macrons.\r\n2. The dictionary adheres to the \"VuIi\" standard of classical Latin, meaning that\r\n   there is no distinction between 'U' and 'V', and neither 'J' nor 'j' used. \r\n   'V' is the uppercase 'u', and 'U' and 'v' are not used. However, the dictionary\r\n   still allows searching for terms by their alternate spellings, including the\r\n   'v' and 'j' variants.\r\n\r\n#### Building the Dictionary\r\n\r\nThe Makefile is preconfigured to build the project using the included \"Dictionary Development Kit\".\r\nIt automatically installs the resulting .dictionary file into the \"~/Library/Dictionaries\" directory.\r\nTo build and install the Dictionary, simply open a Terminal window, navigate to the project directory\r\n(where the Makefile is), and run the following:\r\n\r\n    make all install clean\r\n\r\nThis will first build the dictionary file from the source code (`make all`), then install the `.dictionary`\r\nfile in the user Dictionaries directory (`make install`), and finally delete the build files from the\r\nproject directory (`make clean`). You can run each of these commands separately if you wish, but note\r\nthat they must be run in that order to have the desired effect.",
