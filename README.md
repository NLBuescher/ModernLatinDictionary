Modern Latin Dictionary
=======================

This is a dictionary project written using Mac OS X, Xcode 5, and the Dictionary
Developer Tools from Apple. It is important to not that this is a Latin-language
Dictionary, not a Latin-English Dictionary. The definitions are all in Latin.

To contribute to this project, you must be running Mac OS X and have downloaded
the latest "Auxiliary Tools for Xcode" from the Apple developer page; This will
contain the "Dictionary Development Kit". You should put the "Dictionary
Development Kit" folder into "/Applications/Utilities/". The Makefile for this
project is preconfigured to use that directory.

Guidelines:
  1. Normal Latin text does not have macrons; Only the dictionary entries
  themselves include macrons.
  2.
